In order to master English, you should take small steps to build new habits tailored to your needs. Using gamification and entertainment can make learning more effective and enjoyable. Here is a list of recommended resources.

## Games

- [Wordle](https://wordle.com) is a popular word game that serves as an excellent mental exercise. It is engaging and helps enhance your vocabulary.
- [Grake](https://grake.me), a game that teaches you grammar by playing the popular game snake.
- [Influent](https://playinfluent.com/), which was initially developed by **Rob Howland** as part of a Japanese Government-sponsored research project at the Entertainment Computing Laboratory, part of the University of Tsukuba located in Ibaraki, Japan.

## Vocabulary Tools

For dictionaries, I highly recommend the [Merriam-Webster Dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/). 

Improve your vocabulary with [TermTyper](https://www.termtyper.com/?ref=llanai). It features a quite user-friendly interface and helps you learn new words and their definitions interactively.
