Imagine standing in front of a taco stand in Baja California, surrounded by a cornucopia of tantalizing options: shrimp, fish, seasoned pork, grilled chicken, ground beef, and something that suspiciously resembles calamari. Off to the side, there's a cooler brimming with refreshments—ice-cold beers, sparkling sodas, good-old still water, and the classy party starter, Casamigos Tequila.

You don't speak Spanish and there's no menu in sight. But fear not, you have fingers.

Well, okay, your Spanish extends to "Hola", "Sí", "No", and "Gracias".

So, you greet the old man behind the counter—who's sporting what look like Ray-Ban spectacles—with a cheerful "Hola" and a bright smile. He replies in a raspy voice, "Buenas, señorita." Without hesitation, you start pointing at virtually every dish on display. He replies calmly in Spanish, "No entiendo, no puedo ver."

You pause, slowly realizing the critical error in your plan. You've come on a solo trip to Baja, and the little abuelo is as blind as a bat. Suddenly, you find yourself without a way to communicate your heart's desire.

This, right here, is why you need to learn Spanish.

Below are some effective methods to do just that.

## Sing to Latin Music

I have learned a lot of Spanish and developed new musical interests by listening to Latin music. Whether you're a fan of Ricky Martin and Shakira or you enjoy Mexican Ranchera and Peruvian Cumbia, you're guaranteed to find a genre that resonates with you. Here are some of my favorite artists from various Latin subcultures:

### Mexican
- Aida Cuevas, known as the queen of Mariachi, has had a remarkable five-decade-long career. [Listen to her take over the airwaves here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZHS22YlwgI&ab_channel=Mariachi2000TV).
- Vicente Fernández, the king of Ranchera, has songs that are eternal. [Check them out here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbKhT7L7veI&ab_channel=BlackjackCasinoBand).

### Peruvian
- Eva Ayllón, the queen of landó, an Afro-Peruvian genre, began singing at age 3 under the tutelage of her maternal grandmother. She is a living legend. [Here's a sample of her talent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0BfhWDi_S0c&ab_channel=EvaAyllon).
- Juaneco y su Combo, pioneers of the Chicha genre in the early '70s, created a unique sound after the Peruvian Amazonian people discovered Colombian Pop. [Enjoy the classic "Ya se ha muerto mi abuelo"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBQi8PVq4uI&ab_channel=DavidTarazona).

### Cuban
- Buena Vista Social Club, a Cuban music ensemble formed in 1996, showcased popular Cuban musical styles such as son cubano, danzón, bolero, and guajira. [Here is their eponymous album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fE4Sf7vXgbo&list=PLetv3SCC-r3bPinnDE7jWxKPJc-mpEalB&ab_channel=BuenaVistaSocialClub).
- Ibrahim Ferrer, who retired in 1991 and later made a comeback with the Buena Vista Social Club, has music that speaks for itself. [Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjTcKP7JwfY&list=PLetv3SCC-r3YSbGk-sqepcZ0urvzDUe2T&ab_channel=WorldCircuitRecords).

### Puerto Rican
- Elvis Crespo, a pioneer of Tropical music, has created many classics. [Listen to one here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPiEbYSF9kE&ab_channel=ElvisCrespoVEVO).
- Hector Lavoe from Ponce, Puerto Rico, known for his perfect diction and supreme jazz syncopation, captivated audiences. He hailed from a musical family and loved to entertain. [His music is timeless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D52b-TP9bJE&ab_channel=HURST).

### Spanish
- Enrique Iglesias, known as the king of Latin pop, inherited much of his talent from his legendary father, Julio Iglesias. [Enjoy 24 songs from the king here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4EpQBJFpC8&ab_channel=MusicNight).
- Rosalía, a Grammy-decorated pop star, skillfully blends flamenco, pop, and other genres. [Enjoy this playlist of her greatest hits](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=540ov9gQzcg&ab_channel=HistoryMusik).

## Live in a Latin Country

Living in a Latin country is the most effective way to master the language.

In 2017, I worked for a few months at a factory in Mexico City, where all operators spoke only Spanish. I had to train and supervise teams using my prior knowledge of Spanish. No company employee was required to speak Spanish due to our company's relationship with the manufacturer. However, building relationships with people requires speaking their native tongue. This was one of my happiest memories at Impossible Foods.

## Find a Latin Lover

Let us go back to that taco stand, still struggling to find the words to order. Suddenly, Enrique Iglesias appears and smiles at you. Fortunately, he knows some English. You tell him you're starving and need help, so he orders for you. Then you say "Gracias" and he's surprised by your fluency. At that moment, you decide to seriously learn Spanish—it's your only chance with Enrique.

## Telenovelas

Learning a language properly integrates you into its culture. Telenovelas can prepare you for a dramatic life or help you learn the nuances of Latin culture. ["Parientes a la Fuerza"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pvk-j4KLhEQ&ab_channel=TelemundoEnglish) is a dynamic show that captivated my attention from episode one.

## Read in Spanish

Reading is one of the most effective ways to improve your speech rate, pronunciation, and prosody. For true fluency, I recommend reading as much content in Spanish as possible, even setting your phone's operating system to Spanish.

Here are five engaging books for bedtime reading (these are affiliate links; I earn a commission from purchases):

1. ["Circe" by Madeline Miller](https://amzn.to/3UpkROp), an ode to an overlooked mythological character, showcases Circe's pivotal role on her desolate Greek island.
2. ["Don Quijote" by Miguel de Cervantes](https://amzn.to/3UpkROp), a staple of Spanish literature, follows the adventures of two men seeking adventure.
3. ["100 Years of Solitude" by Gabriel García Márquez](https://amzn.to/3UuoOBC), a Nobel Prize-winning novel, is filled with symbolism and metaphor.
4. ["El corazón helado" by Almudena Grandes](https://amzn.to/4a4BftA), digs into Spain's uncomfortable past during the Civil War.
5. ["Como agua para chocolate" by Laura Esquivel](https://amzn.to/3JNaWgQ) charmingly describes a love story on a Mexican ranch.

## Translate

Whenever you encounter a Spanish phrase that you need to use or understand, just translate it. I highly recommend [SpanishDict for its excellent translation features](https://www.spanishdict.com/). I am working on a future version where you can translate from Llanai.

## Play Language Games

Making learning fun boosts your interest in a language. Consider the famous Spanish word game [Wordle](https://spanishwordle.com/), where you guess a new five-letter Spanish word each day. I also created [Grake](https://grake.me), a fun way to learn grammar, which is like snake, except with words you pick in the right order.

## Consistent Effort

None of the above methods matter unless you commit to daily practice. Set aside time to watch a show, take notes, have conversations, and use your new knowledge. If you move to a Spanish-speaking country or neighborhood, make an effort to engage regularly. Excellence is a habit. 

Llanai can help in your journey to learn Spanish. We offer 20-minute lessons on WhatsApp, which are perfect for busy schedules.
