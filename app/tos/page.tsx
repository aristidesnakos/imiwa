          <p>
            The information provided when using the Services is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity 
            in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which would 
            subject us to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. Accordingly, those persons who choose 
            to access the Services from other locations do so on their own initiative and are solely responsible for compliance 
            with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable.

            The Services are not tailored to comply with industry-specific regulations (Health Insurance Portability and 
            Accountability Act (HIPAA), Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), etc.), so if your interactions would 
            be subjected to such laws, you may not use the Services. You may not use the Services in a way that would violate 
            the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA).
