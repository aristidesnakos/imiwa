## Template 1: University Japanese Department Heads

**Subject:** Free Kanji Learning Resource for Your Japanese Students

---

Dear [Professor/Dr. Name],

I hope this email finds you well. My name is [Your Name], and I'm reaching out from MichiKanji, a comprehensive online kanji learning platform designed specifically to support Japanese language education.

I came across your program at [University Name] and was impressed by [specific detail about their program - e.g., "your comprehensive curriculum" or "your study abroad partnerships with Japanese universities"].

**Why I'm reaching out:**

We've developed a free resource that many Japanese instructors have found valuable for their students:

- **Interactive Stroke Order Practice**: Animated KanjiVG diagrams with proper stroke sequences
- **JLPT-Aligned Organization**: Structured by proficiency levels (N5 through N1)
- **Progress Tracking**: Students can monitor their kanji mastery over time
- **Printable Practice Sheets**: Customizable worksheets for classroom or homework use

**What makes MichiKanji different:**

Unlike passive dictionary tools, we provide opinionated learning guidance. We don't just show students kanji—we guide them to master the right kanji in the right order, following established JLPT progression standards.

**No cost, no registration required for basic features.** Students can start practicing immediately.

I'd love to share how other educators are integrating MichiKanji into their curriculum. Would you be open to a brief conversation? Alternatively, I'm happy to provide you with instructor resources you can share with your students.

## Template 5: Japanese Program Faculty (Research/Academic Angle)

**Subject:** Japanese Kanji Learning Research & Educational Tool

---

Dear [Dr./Professor Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I'm [Your Name], founder of MichiKanji, a digital kanji learning platform informed by second language acquisition research and traditional pedagogy.

Given your work in [mention their specific research interest if known, e.g., "Japanese linguistics" or "language pedagogy"], I thought you might be interested in our approach.

**Our methodology:**

- **Structured progression**: Based on JLPT standards and jōyō kanji organization
- **Multimodal learning**: Visual (stroke order), kinesthetic (practice sheets), and cognitive (contextual meanings)
- **Spacing and repetition**: Progress tracking enables students to implement SRS principles
- **Cultural context**: Beyond rote memorization, we provide cultural and etymological context

**Educational philosophy:**

We believe effective kanji learning requires more than access to information—it requires opinionated guidance on learning paths and sequence. Our goal is to reduce cognitive load by providing clear, research-backed progression.

**Potential collaboration:**

I'd be interested in learning about your research and exploring whether MichiKanji could:
- Serve as a tool for your students
- Support any ongoing research in language acquisition
- Provide data insights (anonymized) about learning patterns

The platform is free to use: [Your Website URL]

Would you be open to a brief conversation about potential synergies?

Warm regards,
