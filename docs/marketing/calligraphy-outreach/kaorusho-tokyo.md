**ご連絡の理由 / Why I Am Reaching Out:**

MichiKanji serves thousands of students worldwide who are actively studying kanji and Japanese. Many of our users express interest in deepening their practice through traditional 書道 (shodo).

I discovered Kaorusho through my research and was impressed by your private class offerings that accommodate students of all levels. The personalized instruction you provide in Shinjuku is exactly what many of our users seek when they want to take their kanji practice to the next level.

**ご提案 / Proposal:**

I would like to discuss a potential partnership:

- **Exposure to motivated learners**: Our website traffic includes students specifically interested in kanji mastery—from beginners to advanced
- **Featured listing**: We could introduce Kaorusho to our audience as a recommended school for personalized shodo instruction in Tokyo
- **Mutual benefit**: Your school gains visibility among dedicated students; our users discover authentic, individualized calligraphy training
