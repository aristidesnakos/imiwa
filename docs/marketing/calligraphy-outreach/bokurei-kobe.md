墨礼書道教室 御中

突然のご連絡失礼いたします。

My name is [Your Name], and I am the founder of MichiKanji (michikanji.com), an online kanji learning platform.

まず、私の日本語が不十分であることをお詫び申し上げます。このメールは日本語と英語を混ぜて書かせていただきます。
*(First, I apologize that my Japanese is limited. I am writing this email in a mix of Japanese and English.)*

**ご連絡の理由 / Why I Am Reaching Out:**

MichiKanji serves thousands of students worldwide who are actively studying kanji and Japanese. Many of our users express interest in deepening their practice through traditional 書道 (shodo).

I discovered Bokurei through my research and was impressed by your dedication to making shodo accessible with multiple locations in the Kobe area and your English-language resources. The Kansai region is a popular destination for our users studying Japanese, and Bokurei offers an excellent opportunity for them to experience authentic calligraphy.

**ご提案 / Proposal:**

I would like to discuss a potential partnership:

- **Exposure to motivated learners**: Our website traffic includes students specifically interested in kanji mastery—many exploring the Kansai region
- **Featured listing**: We could introduce Bokurei to our audience as a recommended school for shodo instruction in Kobe
- **Mutual benefit**: Your school gains visibility among dedicated international students; our users discover accessible calligraphy training outside of Tokyo
