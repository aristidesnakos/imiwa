書道ジャパン 御中

突然のご連絡失礼いたします。

My name is [Your Name], and I am the founder of MichiKanji (michikanji.com), an online kanji learning platform.

まず、私の日本語が不十分であることをお詫び申し上げます。このメールは日本語と英語を混ぜて書かせていただきます。
*(First, I apologize that my Japanese is limited. I am writing this email in a mix of Japanese and English.)*

**ご連絡の理由 / Why I Am Reaching Out:**

MichiKanji serves thousands of students worldwide who are actively studying kanji and Japanese. Many of our users express interest in deepening their practice through traditional 書道 (shodo).

I discovered Shodo Japan through my research and was impressed by your combination of in-person and online courses, as well as your custom Kanji artwork services. Your flexible approach to teaching makes shodo accessible to learners everywhere.

**ご提案 / Proposal:**

I would like to discuss a potential partnership:

- **Exposure to motivated learners**: Our website traffic includes students specifically interested in kanji mastery
- **Online course promotion**: Your online offerings are especially relevant to our international audience who cannot travel to Japan
- **Mutual benefit**: Your school gains visibility among dedicated students; our users discover authentic shodo instruction they can access remotely

**次のステップ / Next Steps:**

お時間をいただければ、短いオンラインミーティングまたはメールでのやり取りで詳細をご相談できれば幸いです。

*(If you have time, I would be grateful to discuss details through a brief online meeting or email exchange.)*

ご検討いただけますと幸いです。
